<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a woman of many hats. I enjoy far to many things and spend a ton of time doing all of the things I enjoy and will forever be adding on to my list.
</p>

<p>I have worked the majority of my life as a Cosmetologist, most of my places of employment being barbershops. As much as I do enjoy the artistry of hair and meeting so many new people everyday, I am ready to make a change in my career path.</p>

<p>In 2019, I graduated as Valedictorian from Full Sail University majoring in Computer Animation. I love art in all forms. I really have an interest in coding and find it very facinating to be able to create so many things with code. I plan to continue learning and improving my coding ablilities and pursue an opportunity to begin a new career path.</p>
